### Exercises

|     Keyword      |     Response      |

> **Question:** What happens when more than one keyword appears in a string? Consider the string “My mother has a dog but no cat.” Explain how to prioritize responses in the reply method.

You can prioritize responses in the reply method by placing if statements before other ones, since the one that is found first is the one that will return the response.

---

### Question

> 1. What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the responses to these statements.

The problem with these statements is that the response the bot returns has nothing to do with what was input.
