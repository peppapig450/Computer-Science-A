# PetClass 

## 5.4.2 Programming Challenge : Class Pet 

This is my work for the 5.4.2 Programming Challenge. 

### Running it! 
./run.sh on a machine with bash on it will compile and run the java program. 

> Note: because we didnt turn it in on Runestone, my code is split up into 2 different files and the class names are different.

- Also for some reason Runestone won't give me points for accessor methods, toString method and creating 3 Pet objects even though I do.
